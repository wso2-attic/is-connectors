authTiqr module
================

The authTiqr module provides support for logging in using tiqr 
(http://tiqr.org). There are two authentication modules:

`authTiqr:Tiqr`
: Authenticate the user using tiqr.

`authTiqr:TiqrUserPass`
: Authenticate the user using tiqr or one of the user/pass modules.


`authTiqr:Tiqr`
---------------

This module is useful if you want to allow a user to login with a tiqr
identity stored on their mobile phone.

To create a TiqrUserPass authentication source, open
`config/authsources.php` in a text editor, and add an entry for the
authentication source:

    'tiqr' => array(
    	'authTiqr:Tiqr'
    ),

Configuration for tiqr takes place in a separate configuration file
called module_tiqr.php for which an example can be found in the 
config-templates/ directory.

`authTiqr:TiqrUserPass`
-----------------------

This module is useful if you want to allow a user to login using either a 
traditional username/password authentication source like LDAP or using
their tiqr identity stored on their mobile phone. 

To create a TiqrUserPass authentication source, open
`config/authsources.php` in a text editor, and add an entry for the
authentication source:

    'tiqrUserPass' => array(
    	'authTiqr:TiqrUserPass',
    	'userPassSource' => 'ldap'
    ),
    
You should update the name of this authentication source (`tiqrUserpass`), 
and the username/password authentication source it references, to have a 
name which makes sense to your organization.

The TiqrUserPass authentication sources only has one option: the 
`userPassSource` option, and it is required. It is a simple string which
contains the name of the configured username/password authentication source
you want to combine with the tiqr login.

Configuration for tiqr takes place in a separate configuration file
called module_tiqr.php for which an example can be found in the 
config-templates/ directory.

NOTE:
You currently have to make a small change in the SimpleSAML PHP sources
to be able to use the TiqrUserPass authentication source. Open the file
`modules/core/lib/Auth/UserPassBase.php` and change the following line:

	abstract protected function login($username, $password);
	
To:

	abstract public function login($username, $password);

You have to make the same change for the username/password authentication
source of your choice. For example, in case of ldap authentication you
have to apply this change to the file `/ldap/lib/Auth/Source/LDAP.php'.
